Description:

I will do a (mini) facebook/slack-like app.
Each user will have his own friend and will be able to see their posts.
Users will be able to both text other friend privately and open multiple users conversations. 
Moreover users will be able to post messages, and also comment their friends' posts.

Implementation Remarks:

Login window will be the first thing that users see when they open the application.
There they will have 2 options: register - to choose their credentials, or log in (only with credentials that exist in the system)
After log in we have a consistent toolbar in the left side of the window with a list of option/features, like:
post a message, send message to a friend, create a group, search for a friend, search for a group and etc.
In the middle there will be an "live" window - updated with any published post.
There will also be a button in the bottom part of the post with the option to comment it.
